When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

This would be for collaborating with other people.  If I was only programming for myself, I might just be using dropbox.  But I will
learn about the functionality of gihub and see how it goes.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
1. If collaborating, I dont want updates from other people to interfere with what I am working on.
2. Also, if Git is staying up-to-date automatically, wouldn't I lose my changes automatically every time Git updates?

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you use one instead of another?
Forks are clones made in github.  When you dont have permission to change someone elses repository.
You copy it into your own account. That is a fork.  A clone is when you copy a repository. So a fork is a clone in github,
but you can also clone a repository in your local computer also.  Branching is adding code, but not commiting
to the master branch.  This is to create two distinct versions of your code.
