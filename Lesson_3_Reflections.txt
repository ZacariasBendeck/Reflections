When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

This would be for collaborating with other people.  If I was only programming for myself, I might just be using dropbox.  But I will
learn about the functionality of gihub and see how it goes.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
1. If collaborating, I dont want updates from other people to interfere with what I am working on.
2. Also, if Git is staying up-to-date automatically, wouldn't I lose my changes automatically every time Git updates?

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you use one instead of another?
Forks are clones made in github.  When you dont have permission to change someone elses repository.
You copy it into your own account. That is a fork.  A clone is when you copy a repository. So a fork is a clone in github,
but you can also clone a repository in your local computer also.  Branching is adding code, but not commiting
to the master branch.  This is to create two distinct versions of your code.

Important!
you have to things in you local repository.
1.  origin and origin/master
2.  origin is what you commit locally, origin/master is the last push or pull from github.

Fast-Forward Merge:
A must be reachable from B, that is the only condition.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
The benefit is the ability to merge future changes.  With this local branch
we will be able to compare the updated remote master branch to the last state we
pulled, and also our own local last commit to this local.  It is good information to
have also so we know what we are uploading before we update the remote repository.
